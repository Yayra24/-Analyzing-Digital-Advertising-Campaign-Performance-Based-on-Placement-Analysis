# -Analyzing-Digital-Advertising-Campaign-Performance-Based-on-Placement-Analysis

# Abstract 

This project examines the performance of a company's digital advertising campaigns across various placements by analyzing key metrics, including cost, revenue, profit, and Return on Investment (ROI). The analysis is based on a dataset consisting of campaign performance data for three months. Through this investigation, the project identifies trends in monthly and daily performance, highlights areas for optimization, and provides actionable recommendations for improving the efficiency of future campaigns. The goal is to provide insights on how to better allocate advertising spend to maximize ROI and minimize losses.

# Introduction 

In digital advertising, understanding the performance of different campaigns is crucial for optimizing ad spend and maximizing returns. This project focuses on analyzing the campaign performance of different placements across multiple months. By exploring metrics like cost, revenue, profit and ROI, the aim is to identify patterns and areas where resources can be better allocated for future campaigns.
The dataset analyzed includes monthly and daily performance figures, including total costs, revenue, profit, and ROI, for three campaigns. The key goal is to identify trends, and actionable insights to improve the performance of future ad placements.

The objective of the analysis is to:

Identify which campaign placement is the most efficient.

The relationship between cost and profitability across placement.

How campaign performance vary across different month.

Which campaign is the most cost efficient in terms of ROI.

# Methodology 

The dataset includes a wide range of metrics related to the company's advertising campaign performance. These metrics can be categorized into several key groups, which help evaluate the overall effectiveness of the campaign. Below is the breakdown of the key metrics in the dataset:

 1. # Campaign Performance Metrics
Cost: The total expenditure on the ad campaign.

Revenue: 
The total revenue generated by the ad campaign, including both clicks and post-click sales.

Profit: Calculated as the difference between revenue and cost. It represents the net gain or loss from the campaign.

Return on Investment (ROI): This metric shows the profitability of the campaign. It is calculated as (Revenue - Cost) / Cost, and it reflects the efficiency of the investment in generating profit.

2. # User Engagement Metrics
Clicks: The number of times users clicked on the ad.

Displays: The number of times the ad was displayed to users.

Post-click Sales: The revenue generated from sales that occurred after the user clicked the ad.

Post-click Conversion: The percentage of users who completed a desired action (like making a purchase) after clicking the ad.

3. # Ad Placement Metrics
Placement: This refers to where the ad was displayed (e.g., abc, def, ghi, etc.). Each placement corresponds to different platforms, types of media, or ad locations.

Placement Count: The frequency or number of times a particular placement occurred across the dataset.

4. # Time-based Metrics
Month: The specific month during which the campaign occurred (e.g., April, May, June).

Day: The specific day within a month on which the campaign data was recorded. This helps analyze daily trends in campaign performance.

5. # Campaign Efficiency Metrics
Placement Share: This shows how much each placement contributed to the total placement count across the entire dataset (expressed as a percentage).

Revenue Share: This shows how much each placement contributed to the total revenue generated across the dataset (expressed as a percentage).

Cost Share: This shows the percentage of the total campaign cost that each placement accounted for.

Profit Share: This reflects how much each placement contributed to the overall profit from the campaign.

These metrics give a comprehensive view of how each element of the campaign (placement, user interaction, cost, revenue, and time) influences the overall performance. By analyzing these metrics, one can identify areas of improvement, optimize future campaigns, and make data-driven decisions to maximize ROI.

# Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel/Pivot Tables: To organize and summarize the data.
Data Visualization Tools: For graphical representation of trends (e.g., bar charts, line graphs).

# Methods

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and organized to ensure that all metrics were represented correctly to ensure there are no missing values, duplicates, and proper formatting.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Pivot tables were used to summarize and analyze the data by month, campaign, and placement. This method allows for quick identification of performance trends.
ROI Calculation: The ROI for each campaign was calculated to assess the effectiveness of the ad spend in generating returns.
Visualization: Graphs were created to visualize monthly performance trends, cost vs. revenue comparisons, and ROI calculations.

# Results 

The analysis revealed several key trends:

1. # Monthly Trends:
April showed the strongest performance, with a profit of ₵79,527.24, while June faced challenges, recording a loss of ₵2,364.07, despite higher costs. This variation highlights the importance of monitoring performance trends over time and adjusting campaigns accordingly

2. # Daily Trends:
Campaigns performed better early in the month (e.g., Day 1 of April), showing a high ROI. As the month progressed, particularly near Day 31, there was a noticeable decline in ROI, suggesting ad fatigue or diminishing returns at the end of each month.

3. # Placement-wise Analysis:
While Campaign "mno" had the largest share of the total cost its ROI was lower showing that, higher cost don’t always correlate with higher profitability. In contrast, placement “abc” with a smallest cost had an efficient spend producing a positive ROI and modest profit.
Campaign "ghi" generates the highest share of revenue at 54.86% despite having a small share of cost (35.51%). It accounts for more than half of the total revenue indicating it is highly cost effective at driving revenue.

# Discussion:
The analysis reveals that there are clear patterns in campaign performance based on both the time of the month and the specific campaign placement. Here are the key findings:

Early-Month Performance: Campaigns tend to perform better early in the month, as indicated by the higher ROI at the beginning of April and May. This suggests that ad fatigue and audience saturation may affect the effectiveness of ads as the month progresses.

Cost Efficiency: High-cost campaigns like "mno" and "ghi" generated substantial revenue, but their high costs reduced the overall ROI. More cost-efficient campaigns such as "abc" and "jkl" demonstrated better ROI relative to their cost, suggesting the importance of balancing ad spend with expected returns.

ROI Optimization: The negative ROI in June emphasizes the importance of real-time monitoring and the need for mid-campaign adjustments. It’s crucial to optimize campaigns continuously to ensure maximum profitability.

# Conclusion:
The analysis of the digital advertising campaigns reveals that campaign performance can vary greatly depending on both the timing within the month and the specific placement. While some campaigns showed high returns early in the month, others struggled due to poor performance in later stages.

The overall takeaway is that careful monitoring of both daily and monthly performance trends, combined with targeted cost management, can lead to improved campaign profitability. Moreover, a well-balanced allocation of resources across placements can help optimize return on ad spend.

# Recommendations for Optimizing Future Campaigns:

Time Campaigns for Maximum Impact:
Launch campaigns early in the month to take advantage of higher audience engagement and avoid ad fatigue towards the end of the month.

Optimize Ad Spend Across Placements:
Focus on campaigns that offer high ROI relative to cost. For example, "abc" and "jkl" had better ROI and should be prioritized.

Continuous Monitoring and Mid-
Campaign Adjustments:
Implement real-time monitoring to track performance closely and adjust campaigns as needed, particularly if performance begins to lag (as seen in June).

Cost Efficiency Focus:
Evaluate high-cost placements and determine if the returns justify the spend. Even if revenue is high, if costs outweigh profits, consider reallocating funds to more efficient campaigns.

Diversify Placements:
Avoid over-relying on a single campaign. Spread the budget across multiple placements to test which channels are most effective at driving revenue while maintaining profitability.

By applying these recommendations, the company can enhance future campaign performance, ensuring higher profitability and better use of marketing resources.
